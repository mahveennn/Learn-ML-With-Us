Abdu notes:
innovation has always served to help man and 
make their lives easier, but when is it a problem for
making our lives too easy?


Hasan notes:
MLG 3 - this episode talks about innovation and how AI is changing the world
---- 4 philosophical talks about AI ----- 
Automation of the economy (medical, web design, cars, taxes etc.) 
  Creativity is not exempt from AI Fear ( ex. losing jobs) and excitement ( ex. self driving cars) both come out of the AI revolution 

The singularity term which means the point of no return

The notion of AGI is making our lives better is good, but making another AGI with a previous AGI (seed AI) is better because it evolves, but it reaches a singularity 

Conciousness might be “the last bastion of unsolved life riddles” - is the mind a machine? 

An AI is intelligence if it’s effective

Dualism is the soul is different from the brain
