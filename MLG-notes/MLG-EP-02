Notes on Episode 2 of the Machine Learning Guide Podcast
Abdu notes: 
 -Whete can AI help us and hurt us as humans? 
- I wonder if it would be beneficial to get into neural networks, or if we should stay with basic models like Linear Regression 
- ML Prefers row structured data while Data analytics prefers column structured data. 
I think data analytics is interesting but we should focus on one thing at a time in order to not make the structure of the DB complicated.
I also don’t think we will be diving into business intelligence either -Data seems to be the driving factor of machine learning and is the input in ML models. 
- Where will we be getting our data from, and will we have to clean it? 
-thoughts on potentially making our own ML model instead of using existing ones?
-unlike bigger companies, when we learn I don’t think we should specificalize in specific roles so that we can learn the breadth of the process 
- I’ve used Bayes theory in probability. I’m interested in seeing how we use his findings in ML 
- ⁠I can now understand the difference between AI and ML 
- ⁠it seems we are in another AI boom. I don’t think this time we’ll under deliver due to much stronger computing power and big data
