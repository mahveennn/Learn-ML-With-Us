Algorithm plus the pattern it learns is the model 

Features are pieces of the house that contribute to prediction (# of houses, distance to Quentin,etc)

Features are most important t part, algorithm looks at row, and learns coefficient to multiply

Features are variables x,y,z

Combination of rows and columns is matrix

1. Infer/predict
2. Error/loss function 
3. Train/learn 

Last column is the actual value, ML model adjusts coefficient based on prediction accordingly 

Retrain model is online learning 

Supervised learning, training on data: linear and logistic regression 
Ex: price of house, cat or dog

Unsupervised learning, machine clusters into a bin, ml algo funds what is in common

Reinforcement learning: taking steps, give it a goal: system of reward and punishment 
ML also figures out on its own the rules, actions, and brst strategy to achieve goal. It trains itself and is action oriented
