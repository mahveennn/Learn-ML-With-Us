# Machine Learning 
Notes on anything Machine Learning that I find on my journey to discover the space. I will be working with 3 other people to discover the depth of ML and AI. We will start with the Machine Learning Guide podcast, and move into ML courses by Stanford and Google. This repo will have notes and implementations in Python from all 4 of us.
